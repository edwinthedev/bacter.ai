Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is what the WHO calls the "silent pandemic" — 1.27 million deaths per year, projected to kill 10 million/year by 2050. When a patient has a bacterial infection, doctors currently wait 2-3 days for a culture to determine which antibiotics will work. During that wait, they guess. Often wrong. Patients die.
